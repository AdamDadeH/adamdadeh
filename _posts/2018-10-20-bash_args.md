title: "Bash Arg Parsing"

As much as I prefer nearly any other language to Bash (what is the proper term for Bash script language)
time and again I find myself scripting in Bash.

* Working with existing Bash scripts in a code-base
* 'Quick' command line utilities.

A recent challenge I ran into was how to handle Bash arg parsing well.

Qualities of Interest
======================

1. Brittleness : Likelihood of method leading to errors during development.
2. User Readability : Ability to infer meaning of arugments for the user.
3. Maintainability : Ability of the arg parsing to be modified.
4. Ability to handle optional arguments.
5. Ease of development.

Variants
==============

Positional
--------------

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "arg1 : $1"
echo "arg2 : $2"
```

* Ease of Development : Very easy for simple use cases - 1-3 required arguments.
* Optional Arguments : Difficult. Can allow trailing arguments to be optional, but requires a strict ordering of which arguments
you expect the user to use. Could use a sentinel value to indicate default.
* Hard to read : ```my_script file1 file2``` doesn't give any hints as to what is happening. Even if we know there is a source and target file - which is which?
* Hard to debug : Highly related to being hard to read - if we have a sequence of 6 arguments ```my_script 1 2 5 3 4 6``` not obvious when arguments are not placed correctly.

getopts
---------------

* [bash hackers](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/howto/getopts_tutorial)
* [gnu - getopts](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html)
* [manpage](https://ss64.com/bash/getopts.html)
* [Examples - Kevin Sookocheff](https://sookocheff.com/post/bash/parsing-bash-script-arguments-with-shopts/)
* [Examples - atomic object](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2011/03/30/parsing-arguments-in-bash-with-getopts/)

Getopts was first introduced in 1986 in the Bourne shell [Bourne Shell Family](http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/bourne/)

Basic example

```optarg_example.sh```

```bash
vflag=off
while getopts vf: opt
do
    case "$opt" in
      v)  vflag=on;;
      f)  filename="$OPTARG";;
      \?)       # unknown flag
          echo >&2 \
      "usage: $0 [-v] [-f filename] [file ...]"
      exit 1;;
    esac
done
shift `expr $OPTIND - 1`
```

The syntax ```getops a:bc: opt``` indicates that getopts can expect

* Options ```-a, -c``` followed by arguments that will get stored in ```OPTARG```
* An option ```-b```
* None of the options are required.
* Getopt will throw an error if not followed by an argument : ```option requires an argument```
* When an option ```-a```, etc is found the character ```a``` is stored in ```opt```.

What is happening? Getopts steps through the command line values looking for the flags definedsets and manipulates the following variables.

* OPTIND - current index initialized to 1 and needs to be reset to 1 if you want to re-use getopts.
* OPTARG - stores the argument corresponding to current option.

* It will stop parsing on the first non-option / non-argument value (a string that doesn't begin with a hyphen that isn't the argument for any option in front of it).
* It will also stop parsing when it sees ```--``` (double-hyphen)

Pros :

* No longer dependent on order of parameters.
* More readable ```md_convert -i file.md -o bears```. We have more hints - we probably have
an input and an output.
* Option stacking familiar from ```tar -xvf, ls -lm```.
* Commonly used.

Cons :

* Serious issue for me. In the prior example ```bash optarg_example.sh -f -v``` **does not throw an error**. Instead ```-v``` is treated as the argument for ```-f```. This behavior is well known, but is still worisome.
* Doesn't support more readable options ```--input```.

getopt
---------------

A descendent of ```getopts```

[Bahnanm - getopt](http://www.bahmanm.com/blogs/command-line-options-how-to-parse-in-bash-using-getopt)
[man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getopt.3.html)


Why didn't we use getopt in the first place? There is one drawback with the use of getopt: it removes whitespace within arguments. The command line

    one "two three" four
(three command line arguments) is rewritten as
    one two three four
(four arguments). Don't use the getopt command if the arguments may contain whitespace characters.

    case "$1" in
        -v)  vflag=on;;

            echo >&2 "usage: $0 [-v] [file ...]"
            exit 1;;
        *)  break;; # terminate while loop
    esac
    shift
done
```

```

while [ $# -gt 0 ]
do
    case "$1" in
        -v)  vflag=on;;
    -f)  filename="$2"; shift;;
    --) shift; break;;
    -*)
        echo >&2 \
        "usage: $0 [-v] [-f file] [file ...]"
        exit 1;;
    *)  break;; # terminate while loop
    esac
    shift
done
# all command line switches are processed,
# "$@" contains all file names
```
