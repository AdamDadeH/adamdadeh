Background : PhD in theoretical physics - focusing on quantum and classical gravity. Since PhD, I have gravitated more towards research in applied mathematics with a focus on statistics and data science as it is a fertile area for new advancements. 

[List of Publications](http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/A.Henderson.1) from my quantum gravity era. Without academic pressure I have lacked the impetus to write. Although - this page will exist as an outlet for random ideas.

Now Reading :

[Categories for the Working Mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_for_the_Working_Mathematician)
  * A hole in my mathematical background that needed filling.

Past Reading :
---------------

[Cartographies of Time : A History of the Timeline](https://www.amazon.com/Cartographies-Time-Timeline-Daniel-Rosenberg/dp/1616890584)
  * Why : Have been working heavily with time series data, so this piqued my interest.
  * Review : Little focus on the display of time dependent data other than listing discrete events in time, but has some great examples of presenting events in time (and space).

[10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10](http://10print.org)
  * A quick read that inspects an old Commodore 64 BASIC one-liner from various perspectives.
  * Review : An amusing read that displays how code is informed by the era / environment in which is developed. Opens the door to exploring the history and cultural signficance of other pieces of code.
