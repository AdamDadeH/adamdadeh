Background : PhD in theoretical physics - focusing on quantum and classical gravity. Since PhD, I have gravitated
more towards research in applied mathematics with a focus on statistics and data science as it is a fertile area
for new advancements. 

[List of Publications](http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/A.Henderson.1) from my quantum gravity era. Without academic
pressue I have lacked the impetus to write. Although - this page will exist as an outlet for random ideas.



Now Reading : 
-------------

[Cartographies of Time : A History of the Timeline](https://www.amazon.com/Cartographies-Time-Timeline-Daniel-Rosenberg/dp/1616890584)
  * Have been working heavily with time series data, so this piqued my interest.

[Categories for the Working Mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_for_the_Working_Mathematician)
  * A hole in my mathematical background that needed filling.

[10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10](http://10print.org)
  * A quick read that inspects an old Commodore 64 BASIC one-liner from various perspectives.
